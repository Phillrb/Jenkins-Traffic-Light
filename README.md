Jenkins-Traffic-Light
=====================

An OSX app that monitors a Jenkins RSS build feed and updates a soft traffic light and optionally an Arduino via USB

This OSX app is a lightweight tool that: 
- monitors a single Jenkins RSS feed
- updates a virtual traffic light in an NSWindow
- optionally sends the build status to an attached Arduino via USB (see git repo: x for Arduino code)

Features include:
- displaying build status in the OSX status bar, dock and window
- instant notifications in OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and above
- quick links to the monitored Jenkins job or latest build
- configurable Jenkins Job RSS URL

Detail:
- The RSS feed is pulled down every 60 seconds and parsed (feel free to change this value)
- Build status is extracted from RSS
- On a change of status a notification is displayed vis Notification Center in OSX 10.8
- If an Arduino is attached by USB the build status is sent to it (as an integer) utilising the excellent ORSSerialPort class provided by Andrew R. Madsen (see git repo x)

Potential Areas Of Improvement:
- Currently uses simple string parsing to find the build status from the RSS (on the upside it's quick and doesn't need any additional frameworks)
- All settings are stored in NSUserDefaults - could use CoreData or SQLite
- Only one feed is monitored at a time
- A list of favourite Jenkins RSS job feeds could be helpful
- Please feel free to submit additions / tweaks / fixes and I'll add you to the Credits!

Suggested Use Cases:
- Hook up an Arduino to a large life-size traffic light and alert your devs when the build breaks
- Alternatively use a 5V spinning emergency light / alarm for instant escalation on failure!
- Make the soft traffic light larger and display it on a spare screen / projector in the office
